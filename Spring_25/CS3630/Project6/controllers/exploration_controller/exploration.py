def exploration_state_machine(robbie, grid):
    """
    Use frontier planning, or another exploration algorithm, to explore the grid.

    Arguments:
        robbie: instance of the robot
        grid: instance of the grid

    Returns: 
        robbie: 'updated' instance of the robot

    Notes:
        Robot is considered as Point object located at the center of the traingle. 
        Robot explores the map in the discretized space
        You may use the 'rrt' function (see grid.py) to find a new path whenever the robot encounters an obstacle.
        Please note that the use of rrt slows down your code, so it should be used sparingly.
        The 'get_wheel_velocities' functions is useful in setting the robot's velocities.
        You will also find many of the functions declared in 'grid.py' and 'utils.py' useful.
        Feel free to create other helper functions (in this file) as necessary.

    Alert:
        In this part, the task is to let the robot find all markers by exploring the map,
        which means using 'grid.markers' will lead  cause zero point on GraderScope.
